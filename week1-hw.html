            The article addresses the uneven pace of innovation ideation and scientific developments created over time. It calls out the consequences that might be faced in the future in an era of rapid technological advamcements.
            Its fascinating how Bush was able to give an accurate description of what were then futuristic concept ideas on the potential in photography, dpoo
            also hinsta that humanity always has the potential to grow and expand in dcientific inventions and developments, however it only does so when all requiresments are being met(e.g. it is related to a relevant problem, it is receiving adequate budget, etc) 
            
            Throughout the article, Bush also consistently expresses his certainty that all devices and innovations as we know them now will surely operate in remarkably higher rates in the near and distant future. From photography to typewriters, all of these initial scientific developments have been expanded and explored in different forms and rates across the world in the past centuries.
            
            Memex reveals to us that the author had a vision similar to that of the world wide web, however, confined by his own electronical imagination at the time, he was limited to his understandin of "softwares"for the matter, even though by his descriptions ot eould have seemed to be his ideal ideation and designing of memex.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(80, 220, 255);"><b> Tim Berners-Lee's "Long Live the Web" </b></p>
        <p style="color: rgb(80, 220, 255);" >
            <i> "The Web is now more critical to free speech than any other medium."</i> </p>
            <p style="color: rgb(80, 220, 255);">
            In his article "Long Live the Web," Tim Berners-Lee expresses his fascination on how far humanity's development of the Web has gone, and how much more it has to offer. To his belief, universality is key to web improvement, in addition to decentralization, which has made it all the more accessible to all to be active contributors to this new field and movement.
         On the contrary, Berners-Lee also considers the Web to be fragmented, due to its foundational principles of disallowing the automatic sharing of data from one database, company or website to the other. To him, this hinders the internet's initial sense of unity. Another concern is the possibility of monopolies being formed within the web, which would then sabotage further innovations and opportunities for future developers or users to grow, as initially wished by the founding ideators. 
            On that note. the author expresses the importance of valuing openness (royalty-free, non-profit, accessible to all) in the overall internet community. He continuously criticizes Apple's approach in making its features more exclusive and separated from the usual internet URLs, which challenges his own ideal beliefs of the Web. Nevertheless, he remains very positive and optimistic of the future, as latest innovations such as HTML5 as well as linked and digestible data have proven to suggest a promising future of our society depending on the significance of the internet.
