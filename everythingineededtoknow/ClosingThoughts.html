        <div id="normalText"> It is great luck to live in a society full of information. If there was any information they wanted to obtain, the ancestors had to directly contact the media to obtain information, such as visiting experts in person for interviews or reading the encyclopedia. But now it's different. Just by searching keywords for the information, we want to get, there are millions of related information in less than a second. Is Google the only one here? Various tutorials and videos of people experimenting are also uploaded on YouTube. It also delivers information through video. We can find information anytime, anywhere.
		However, don't forget that you have to pay for it accordingly. Although you are provided with algorithm-like convenience through your search data, it also means that the service provider steals who you are and what your thoughts are.
		There is a word “Media Literacy’. Media literacy consists of practices that allow people to access, critically evaluate, and create or manipulate media. Media literacy is not restricted to one medium and is understood as a set of competencies that are essential for work, life, and citizenship. In these days, this sense is the most required thing we have to confront the wave.
