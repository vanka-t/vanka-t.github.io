        <div id="normalText"> <b>Vanessa's Thoughts</b> Although I liked the concept behind it, overall I had mixed feelings on the execution. When hearing about this kind of project, you cant help but assume and expect to explore a new level of rawness and honesty. Everyones internet history is so vulnerable, and so although Sym's has explained why she did not want the searches to be that realistic, it did feel slightly disappointing 
		So although her concept is very interesting, I personally found this search engine approach to not have been the best medium.

        <div id="normalText"> <b>Alwyn's Thoughts</b>' user journey is simple: the user/audience types letters into a classic search bar and
            all of the suggestions shown are searches taken from the artist'â€™ own internet history 
            - They are mostly random and/or ambiguous searches
            - By clicking at one of them, the websites sends you to the actual landing page of the search
            - The user is thus using a search engine limited by what the artist has search on their own in the past 3 years

        <div id="normalText"> <b>Ama's Thoughts</b>' I found it interesting her focus was more on the act of searching itself rather than the terms searched.

		My dad always would say you kids are fortune to have the internet and Google when it comes time for you to find information. When he was kid you had to scour the library for books to find the information he needed. I did do that when I was in elementary school, but then here comes middle school, high school and college where everything is accessible. 

		Yes, it is quite a benefit, but it actually uncomforatble to know someone I do not is collecting data on me based on my searches, likes, past purchases, etc. It reminds me I have to be mindful and honestly make me want to limit my social presence, but how can I do that when everything is made simply from the internet. I use try and buy like DVDs and books to have a physical copy to start and try to be in the real world and have some kind of privacy.
